## [3.0.0-beta.3] (2021-06-21)

### Changed
- Replaced all bare except:
- [#9](https://github.com/hasl-sensor/integration/issues/9) fixed. Implemented skeleton async_migrate_entry

## [3.0.0-beta.2] (2021-06-14)

### Fixes
- [#7](https://github.com/hasl-sensor/integration/issues/7) fixed. Too many programming languages I guess... =)
- [#6](https://github.com/hasl-sensor/integration/issues/6) fixed. Fault management implemented.
- Fixed double type datetime.datetime vs datetime in haslworker

## [3.0.0-beta.1] (2021-06-11)

Generally stuff could be really broken right now and I'm working on lots of stuff all over the code.
Forked from 2.2.3 but changes from later versions are implemented as needed.

### Changed (summarized)
- Moving into the new organization on github and renaming to integration
- Changed domain from hasl to hasl3
- Removed dependency on external hasl-communication-library and replaced by internal slapi dependency instead
- Using httpx async in slapi library
- Added GUI configuration for the integration
- Metadata added to the home assistant wheels repo, PR [#48](https://github.com/home-assistant/wheels-custom-integrations/pull/48) and [#57](https://github.com/home-assistant/wheels-custom-integrations/pull/57)
- Icons added to the home assistant brands repo, PR [#1606](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands/pull/1606) and [#1626](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands/pull/1626)
- Changed the unique naming of all enteties generated to be truly unique and stay the same over time
- Allow use of multiple API-keys for different sensors using multiple integrations
- Enforce time based caching between all integrations to reduce wear on the API-keys
- Workers to handle updates etc are now run on one minute intervalls using call-backs to be friendlier on hass
- Sensors are "just" retreiving data from the workers data instead of directly interfacing the apis.
- Devices are now created for each integration to be used for future automation etc
- Departures entity is now providing Deviation data only if a Deviation integration is configured with the same stops/lines to decrease complexity but maintaining compability both with new and old architechture.
- Deviation sensors are now availiable as separate entites/sensors if needed and are leveraged by the Departures sensors if they exist.
- A common in-memory structure for all data is now done using a worker holding data for all instances instead of writing to disk
- Updated hacs.json and info.md to be updated for v3
- Service for dumping the cache to disk have been implemented
- Fixed lots of bugs related to data not beeing available yet (async issues)
- Generic extensible queing system built in
- Services for location lookup and trip planning implemented
- Traffic status now is one sensor per traffic type to make it simpler to display status
- All sensortypes works and returns some kind of data if configured with valid data
- Added dependency on jsonpickle as the builtin json serialiser kind of sucks
- Added version field to manifest
- Added system health checks
- Services now response on the event bus by hasl3_response
- Services can be called via the event bus on hasl3_execute with argument cmd=<service> and then the rest of the argument as when normally using when calling a service
- Binary sensor logging and fault management implemented
- Slapi and haslworker logging and fault management implemented
- Sensor logging and fault management implemented
- Changed fork from DSorlov to hasl-sensor
